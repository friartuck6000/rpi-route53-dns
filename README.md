~~Inspired~~ Pretty much stolen from:

[Roll your own dynamic DNS service using Amazon Route53](https://willwarren.com/2014/07/03/roll-dynamic-dns-service-using-amazon-route53/)

All I did was add _slightly_ better logging and move sensitive variables to a separate environment file.

If anyone besides me ever stumbles across this repo, just open an issue and I'll write setup instructions. :tada:
